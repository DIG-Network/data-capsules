## API Reference

### Main Functions

#### `computeProofOfWorkAsync(entropySeed, difficulty, maxAttempts?, logAttempts?, doubleSha?): ProofOfWorkHandle`

Computes proof of work asynchronously using Bitcoin's target-based difficulty system. Returns immediately with a handle for cancellation and progress tracking.

**Parameters:**
- `entropySeed` (Buffer): The entropy seed (plotId) to bind the work to
- `difficulty` (number): Bitcoin-style difficulty level (1.0 = easiest, higher = harder)
- `maxAttempts` (number, optional): Maximum attempts before giving up (default: unlimited)
- `logAttempts` (boolean, optional): Whether to log each hash attempt (default: false)
- `doubleSha` (boolean, optional): Whether to use double SHA-256 like Bitcoin (default: true)

**Returns:** `ProofOfWorkHandle` for cancellation and progress tracking

#### `verifyProofOfWork(entropySeed, nonce, difficulty, doubleSha?): boolean`

Verifies that a nonce produces a hash that meets the Bitcoin difficulty target.

**Parameters:**
- `entropySeed` (Buffer): The entropy seed that was used
- `nonce` (number): The nonce to verify
- `difficulty` (number): The required difficulty level
- `doubleSha` (boolean, optional): Whether to use double SHA-256 (default: true)

**Returns:** `true` if the nonce is valid for the given difficulty

#### `verifyProofOfWorkStandardized(entropySeed, nonce, difficulty, expectedVersion?, doubleSha?): boolean`

**CONSENSUS CRITICAL:** Standardized verification with algorithm validation. This function verifies both the proof of work AND the algorithm compatibility.

**Parameters:**
- `entropySeed` (Buffer): The entropy seed that was used
- `nonce` (number): The nonce to verify
- `difficulty` (number): The required difficulty level
- `expectedVersion` (number, optional): Expected algorithm version (default: current)

### ProofOfWorkHandle Methods

The handle returned by `computeProofOfWorkAsync` provides these methods:

#### `cancel(): void`
Cancels the running proof of work computation.

#### `isCancelled(): boolean`
Returns `true` if the computation has been cancelled.

#### `isCompleted(): boolean`
Returns `true` if the computation has found a valid solution.

#### `hasError(): boolean`
Returns `true` if there was an error (cancelled or max attempts reached).

#### `getError(): string | null`
Returns the error message if there was an error, or `null` if no error.

#### `getResult(): ProofOfWorkResult | null`
Returns the result if computation completed successfully, or `null` if not completed.

#### `getAttempts(): bigint`
Returns the current number of attempts made (approximate).

#### `getProgress(): ProofOfWorkProgress`
Returns detailed progress information (attempts, elapsed time, etc.).

#### `getDifficulty(): number`
Returns the difficulty level for this computation.

### Result Types

#### `ProofOfWorkResult`
- `nonce` (bigint): The nonce that was found

```typescript
import { 
  computeProofOfWorkAsync,

  verifyProofOfWorkStandardized,
  getAlgorithmVersion,

  const difficulty = 2.0
  
  const handle: ProofOfWorkHandle = computeProofOfWorkAsync(entropySeed, difficulty)
  
  // Wait for completion with proper typing
  const waitForCompletion = async (handle: ProofOfWorkHandle): Promise<ProofOfWorkResult> => {
    while (!handle.isCompleted() && !handle.hasError()) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
    }
    
    if (handle.hasError()) {
      throw new Error(handle.getError() || 'Unknown error')
    }

    if (!result) {
      throw new Error('No result available')
    }
    
    return result
  }

  const isValid: boolean = verifyProofOfWork(
    entropySeed, 
    Number(result.nonce), 
    difficulty
  )
  
  // Standardized verification (recommended for networks)
  const isStandardValid: boolean = verifyProofOfWorkStandardized(
    entropySeed,
    Number(result.nonce),
    difficulty
  )
  
  // Check algorithm parameters
  const params: AlgorithmParameters = getAlgorithmParameters()
  console.log(`Algorithm version: ${params.version}`)
  console.log(`Algorithm spec: ${params.specHash}`)
  
  console.log('Mining completed, valid:', isValid)
  console.log('Consensus valid:', isStandardValid)
}
```

## Difficulty System

This library uses Bitcoin's target-based difficulty system:

- **Difficulty 1.0**: Easiest level, requires 8 leading zero bits in hash
- **Difficulty 2.0**: Requires 12 leading zero bits
- **Difficulty 4.0**: Requires 16 leading zero bits (2 zero bytes)
- **Higher difficulties**: Exponentially more difficult

The difficulty directly corresponds to how computationally expensive it is to find a valid nonce.

## Security & Consensus

This library implements a **consensus-critical verification system** to prevent tampering and ensure network compatibility.

### Algorithm Standardization

- **Version 1 Specification**: `DIG_POW_V1_SMOOTH_LOG_DIFFICULTY_2024`
- **Formula**: `zero_bits = 8 + log2(difficulty) * 2`
- **Immutable Parameters**: All difficulty calculation parameters are locked constants
- **Version Validation**: Algorithm version must match across all network participants

### Security Guarantees

1. **Tamper Detection**: Algorithm spec hash prevents silent modifications
2. **Version Enforcement**: Mismatched versions are rejected automatically
3. **Consensus Compliance**: All parameters are immutable constants
4. **Network Compatibility**: Ensures identical verification across nodes
5. **Upgrade Safety**: Algorithm changes require coordinated hard forks

### Usage for Network Consensus

```javascript
// For production networks: Always use standardized verification
const isValid = verifyProofOfWorkStandardized(entropySeed, nonce, difficulty)

// Check algorithm compatibility
const version = getAlgorithmVersion()  // Returns: 1
const spec = getAlgorithmSpec()        // Returns: "DIG_POW_V1_SMOOTH_LOG_DIFFICULTY_2024"

// Validate all proofs with version checking
function validateNetworkProof(entropySeed, nonce, difficulty) {
  return verifyProofOfWorkStandardized(entropySeed, nonce, difficulty, 1)
}
```

### Network Upgrade Process

To change the difficulty algorithm:
1. Define new algorithm version (e.g., version 2)
2. Update consensus parameters and spec hash
3. Coordinate hard fork across all network participants
4. Validate version compatibility on peer connections

## Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate difficulty levels**: Start with 1.0-4.0 for testing
2. **Monitor progress**: Use the handle to track mining progress
3. **Set reasonable limits**: Use `maxAttempts` for time-critical applications
4. **Handle cancellation**: Always provide a way to cancel long-running operations
